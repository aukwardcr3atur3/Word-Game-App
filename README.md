The load_wordlist() function is introduced to load the wordlist of one billion words. You would need to implement this function to read the wordlist from a file, a database, or any other suitable data source.

The generate_word() function selects a random word from the loaded wordlist. The rest of the code remains similar to the previous example, calculating word bonuses, awarding coins, and handling gameplay for each level.

Please note that working with such a large wordlist may require optimizing your code, using appropriate data structures, and considering memory limitations. Loading the entire wordlist into memory might not be feasible, so you may need to implement techniques like streaming or caching to handle the data efficiently.

Given the scale of the wordlist and the complexity of the game, I recommended to work with experienced developers or consider using distributed computing techniques to handle the processing and storage requirements effectively.
